# Bank
# Bank Marketing Prediction Project

This project aims to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on data from a bank marketing campaign. The analysis and model development were primarily conducted within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Project Overview

The Jupyter Notebook (`bank_marketing_prediction.ipynb` or similar name) contains the following steps:

1.  **Data Loading and Exploration:** Loading the `bank.csv` dataset using Pandas and performing initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data's structure and characteristics.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    -   Encoding categorical features (e.g., 'job', 'marital') into numerical representations using Label Encoding.
    -   Scaling numerical features (e.g., 'age', 'balance') using StandardScaler.
    -   Separating the features (X) and the target variable (y).
    -   Splitting the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
3.  **Model Training:** Training a Logistic Regression model (from scikit-learn) on the training data to predict customer subscription.
4.  **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the trained model's performance on the testing data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and visualizing the results with a confusion matrix.

## Setup Instructions

To run this project, you will need to set up your environment with the necessary dependencies. Follow these steps:

1.  **Install Anaconda (Recommended):** Anaconda is a popular Python distribution that includes Jupyter Notebook, Conda (a package and environment manager), and many commonly used data science libraries. You can download and install it from [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

2.  **Create a Conda Environment (Optional but Recommended):** Creating a separate environment helps manage project dependencies in isolation. Open your terminal or Anaconda Prompt and run:

    ```bash
    conda create --name bank_marketing python=3.x  # Replace 3.x with your desired Python version
    conda activate bank_marketing
    ```

3.  **Install Required Libraries:** If you didn't install Anaconda or want to ensure all necessary libraries are installed in your active environment, run the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```

4.  **Download the Data:** Ensure that the `bank.csv` file is present in the same directory as your Jupyter Notebook or provide the correct path to the data file within the notebook.

5.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    -   Open your terminal or Anaconda Prompt.
    -   Navigate to the directory containing your project files (including the `.ipynb` file).
    -   Run the command:

        ```bash
        jupyter notebook
        ```

    -   This will open Jupyter Notebook in your web browser. Navigate to and open the `bank_marketing_prediction.ipynb` (or the name of your notebook) file.
    -   You can then run the cells in the notebook sequentially to execute the project code and see the results.

## Project Files

-   `README.md`: This file (provides an overview and setup instructions).
-   `bank_marketing_prediction.ipynb` (or similar): The Jupyter Notebook containing the project code and analysis.
-   `bank.csv`: The dataset used for the project.

## Further Exploration

You can further explore this project by:

-   Trying different machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, random forests, support vector machines).
-   Performing more in-depth EDA and feature engineering.
-   Experimenting with different data scaling and encoding techniques.
-   Evaluating the models using more advanced metrics and techniques (e.g., cross-validation, ROC curves).
